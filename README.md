# GWATER v1.3  [![made with - mee++](https://img.shields.io/badge/made_with-mee%2B%2B-2ea44f)](https://)  
This is the repository for the GWater source code and its binary module releases!  
Remember, you also need the workshop addon for this to work! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2700933866  
If you're looking to install the GWater module, you can watch this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlIyqdFmE8k  
If you prefer text, here's a step-by-step guide:  
  
**1.** Go to the Releases and find the newest release  
**2.** Download the GWater installer (`GWater.exe`)  
**3.** Run it!  
It will try to auto-detect your Garry's Mod folder, but if it can't, click the Browse button and select the `GarrysMod` folder (Not `GarrysMod/garrysmod`!)  
**4.** Close Garry's Mod if it's currently open.  
**5.** Press the Install button. It will install the necessary DLLs in the right locations!  
  
### IN CASE THE INSTALLER FAILS: (or any other reason)
Manual install method:  
**1.** Go to the Releases tab and find the newest release  
**2.** Download the `GWater.zip` archive  
**3.** Unpack its contents to a folder, you should see a bunch of dlls  
**4.** Open your `GarrysMod` folder and your `GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin` folder  
**5.** Move the DLLs that *don't* start with `gmcl_` to the `GarrysMod` folder  
**6.** Move the DLLs that *do* start with `gmcl_` (should be 2) to the lua/bin folder from above  
  
If you're having trouble, ask us in [the server we developed GWater in](https://discord.gg/vdsgHsFrx2)!  
Please note that this addon is still in beta.  
It *will* have bugs and issues, but we're working to fix them and make the experience better for you!
